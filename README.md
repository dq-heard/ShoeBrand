# ShoeBrand

This was another early project that's been slowly evolving. ShoeBrand has undergone substantial changes and is responsible for most of my confidence and knowledge with basic front-end development. I merged a Shopping Cart project into what I had already for my fourth page, so any further updates will be for tinkering with more JavaScript or for some minor CSS tweaks.

*Edit: Working on a draggable carousel of cards for my "Newest Arrivals" section on my Shop Page. Trying to keep this project vanilla, so no SwiperJS or other APIs (if I can avoid it). Broken transitions at both ends of my array, so under construction until further notice.
