# ShoeBrand

This was another early project that's been slowly evolving. ShoeBrand has undergone substantial changes and is responsible for most of my confidence and knowledge with basic front-end development. I merged a Shopping Cart project into what I had already for my fourth page, so any further updates will be for tinkering with more JavaScript or for some minor CSS tweaks.
